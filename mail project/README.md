# Mail

A mailing web app similar to Gmail which uses API calls to display, write, read, archive/unarchive mails. The emails being sent and received will be entirely stored in the database (they wonâ€™t actually be sent to real email servers), so fictional mail credentials preferred over the actuals.
Funcitonalities include:
- Send mail: User can send mail to another user.
- Mailbox: One of the mailboxex viz., Inbox, Sent mailbox or archive is loaded based on the user input.
- View Mail: A click will redirect to the content of the mail.
- Archive/Unarchive: A user can archive/unarchive the mails.
- Reply: User can reply to received to mails
